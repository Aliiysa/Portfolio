while Language Models became hot topic in 2020s it is important to know details about them. The Transformer architecture is a crucial and powerful building block in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. It is the foundation for many of the state-of-the-art language models used today, including BERT, GPT-3, and T5. The Transformer architecture enables these models to effectively model and understand the complex relationships between words and phrases in natural language, and has revolutionized the field of NLP. By understanding the Transformer architecture, practitioners and researchers can better design, build, and optimize language models. In addition, the Transformer architecture is also being used in other fields, such as computer vision, and has the potential to impact a wide range of industries in the future.

In this project you can see detailed diagrams about **Transformer Architecture**, mathematical explanation of **Attention Mechanism** and overall view of **Encoder-Decoder** mechanism.

If you ever used Stable Diffusion for image genereation then you already have contacted with **U-Net Architecture**

The U-Net architecture is a popular and effective deep learning architecture for image generation, specifically for image segmentation tasks. The U-Net architecture is composed of an **Encoder** and **Decoder** network that are connected by a bottleneck layer. The encoder network is a series of convolutional layers that gradually downsample the input image, which helps capture and abstract the high-level features of the image. The decoder network is a series of upsampling layers that reconstructs the original size of the image, while also refining the segmentation mask. The bottleneck layer in the middle serves as a bridge between the encoder and decoder networks, and enables the model to effectively capture both local and global features of the image. Additionally, skip connections between the encoder and decoder networks help to preserve the fine details of the image during the downsampling and upsampling process, improving the accuracy of the segmentation mask.

In this project you can see detailed information about **Downsampling**, **Upsampling** and **Bottleneck layers**.

## Finding Donors for CharityML [Click here for view the file](https://github.com/Aliiysa/Portfolio/blob/main/charity_ml.ipynb)

In this project, I utilized several Machine learning algorithms to accurately create a model that can predict an individual's income based on data collected from the 1994 US Census. After obtaining the preliminary results, I selected the best candidate model and further optimized it to obtain the most accurate model possible. The purpose of this implementation is to predict whether an individual earns more or less than 50K. This sort of task is often found in non-profit settings, where the organization relies on donations to survive. Having this prediction would help the non-profit organization to determine the amount of money to request or if they should reach out at all.

*Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn* required.

## Telco Customer Churn Prediction [Click here for view the file](https://github.com/Aliiysa/Portfolio/blob/main/telco_customer_churn.ipynb)

It is essential for telecommunications companies to be able to determine which customers are more likely to leave in order to retain them. As it is more expensive to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones, large telecom companies are striving to build models that can predict customer churn. 
In this project, we create a model that can predict a customer's probability of leaving by analyzing their demographic, account, and services information. The objective is to acquire a data-driven solution that will reduce churn rates, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and the company's revenue.
